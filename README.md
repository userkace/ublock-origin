# Overview

Finally, an efficient blocker. Easy on CPU and memory.

IMPORTANT: uBlock Origin is completely unrelated to the site "ublock.org".

uBlock Origin is not an "ad blocker", it's a wide-spectrum content blocker with CPU and memory efficiency as a primary feature.

***

Out of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:

- uBlock Origin filter lists
- EasyList (ads)
- EasyPrivacy (tracking)
- Peter Loweâ€™s Ad server list (ads and tracking)
- Online Malicious URL Blocklist

More lists are available for you to select if you wish:

- Annoyances (cookie warnings, overlays, etc.)
- hosts-based lists
- And many others

Additionally, you can point-and-click to block JavaScript locally or globally, create your own global or local rules to override entries from filter lists, and many more advanced features.

For users by users.

If ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.
